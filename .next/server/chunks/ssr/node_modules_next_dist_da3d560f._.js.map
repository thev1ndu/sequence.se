To illustrate, if you were to use this data type to store\n * HTTP responses, the keypath would include the URL and everything listed by\n * the Vary header.\n *\n * The order of elements in a keypath must be consistent between lookups to\n * be considered the same, but besides that, the order of the keys is not\n * semantically meaningful.\n *\n * Keypaths may include a special kind of key called Fallback. When an entry is\n * stored with Fallback as part of its keypath, it means that the entry does not\n * vary by that key. When querying the cache, if an exact match is not found for\n * a keypath, the cache will check for a Fallback match instead. Each element of\n * the keypath may have a Fallback, so retrieval is an O(n ^ 2) operation, but\n * it's expected that keypaths are relatively short.\n *\n * Example:\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1], PRODUCT_PAGE_1);\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', Fallback], GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE);\n *\n *   // Exact match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1]) -> PRODUCT_PAGE_1\n *\n *   // Fallback match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 2]) -> GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE\n *\n * Because we have the Fallback mechanism, we can impose a constraint that\n * regular JS maps do not have: a value cannot be stored at multiple keypaths\n * simultaneously. These cases should be expressed with Fallback keys instead.\n *\n * Additionally, because values only exist at a single keypath at a time, we can\n * optimize successive lookups by caching the internal map entry on the value\n * itself, using the `ref` field. This is especially useful because it lets us\n * skip the O(n ^ 2) lookup that occurs when Fallback entries are present.\n *\n\n * How to decide if stuff belongs in here, or in cache.ts?\n * -------------------------------------------------------\n * \n * Anything to do with retrival, lifetimes, or eviction needs to go in this\n * module because it affects the fallback algorithm. For example, when\n * performing a lookup, if an entry is stale, it needs to be treated as\n * semantically equivalent to if the entry was not present at all.\n * \n * If there's logic that's not related to the fallback algorithm, though, we\n * should prefer to put it in cache.ts.\n */\n\ntype MapEntryShared<K extends readonly unknown[], V extends MapValue> = {\n  parent: MapEntry<K, V> | null\n  key: any\n  map: Map<any, MapEntry<K, V>> | null\n\n  // LRU-related fields\n  prev: MapEntry<any, any> | null\n  next: MapEntry<any, any> | null\n  size: number\n}\n\ntype EmptyMapEntry<\n  K extends readonly unknown[],\n  V extends MapValue,\n> = MapEntryShared<K, V> & {\n  value: null\n}\n\ntype FullMapEntry<\n  K extends readonly unknown[],\n  V extends MapValue,\n> = MapEntryShared<K, V> & {\n  value: V\n}\n\nexport type MapEntry<K extends readonly unknown[], V extends MapValue> =\n  | EmptyMapEntry<K, V>\n  | FullMapEntry<K, V>\n\n// The CacheMap type is just the root entry of the map.\nexport type CacheMap<\n  K extends readonly unknown[],\n  V extends MapValue,\n> = MapEntry<K, V>\n\n// The protocol that values must implement.
