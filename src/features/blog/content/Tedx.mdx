# TEDxColombo 2025 — Where Ideas Collide and Minds Expand

![TEDxColombo 2025 Highlights](https://i.postimg.cc/cLsHYymv/54562600271-44de5f8ff7-o.jpg )

TEDxColombo 2025 brought together thinkers, creators, and everyday people with powerful stories.  
I joined the event as a volunteer, and seeing everything from the inside gave me a different kind of understanding.  
Here is my full experience, written simply, with space left for photos I took throughout the day.

## Behind the Scenes: Volunteering Within the “MADness”


![Arrival & Volunteer Briefing](https://i.postimg.cc/yxHBHcpm/Whats-App-Image-2025-06-01-at-13-27-28.jpg)

I arrived early at Nelum Pokuna Theatre for the volunteer briefing.  
The theme was **MADness**—breaking norms and stepping into uncomfortable ideas.  
Even before the doors opened, I felt how much effort goes into making an event like this work.  
Backstage is quiet, but everything starts there.

During the event, I learned valuable lessons about leadership. True leadership is not about commanding but about inspiring and enabling others to succeed. Watching the TEDxColombo team work together seamlessly, I saw how clear communication, trust, and shared purpose can turn a vision into reality.

#### **Yevan David: Mindset Is Everything**

        title="Yevan David TEDxColombo" 
        style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} 
        frameBorder="0" 
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

Yevan spoke about racing at 250 mph and how presence can save your life.  
He shared how he left home at 13 to live alone in Italy.  
His lesson was simple: **resilience grows from struggle, not comfort.**

#### **Jason Rajasinghe: Adapting to Chaos**
<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2064LlhKhY" 
        title="Jason Rajasinghe TEDxColombo" 
        style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} 
        frameBorder="0" 
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

Jason talked about the Sri Lankan reality—how our systems make simple things difficult.  
He explained how we move through “15 steps when others take 2.”  
His message: **adaptation is survival. Stress can push us to evolve.**  
His reminder stayed with me:  
> “It’s okay—it’s just life. Don’t let the weight slow you down.”

### **Audience Engagement & Social Space**

![Audience Engagement](https://i.postimg.cc/NM3TwsHp/54562930190-d1dae9f3cd-o.jpg)

The audience was deeply engaged, with lively discussions in the social space.  
This was where ideas were exchanged, connections were made, and the spirit of TEDx truly came alive.

When the event began, the hall filled quickly.  
From the side, I saw people reacting to every talk—nodding, thinking, leaning forward.  
Outside, the social space was full of conversations, coffee, and new connections.  
This showed me that ideas spread not only on stage, but in the small moments between people.

## Theme 2: **Game On — Infinite vs Finite Thinking**

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S16XUhMp-Ro" 
        title="Sanjiva Weerawarana TEDxColombo" 
        style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} 
        frameBorder="0" 
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

Sanjiva Weerawarana used a cricket example to explain the difference between winning and truly building something meaningful.

- Sri Lanka makes **$1.5B in IT exports**, mostly outsourcing.  
- The real potential is in **products**, not just services.  
- Deep learning matters more than scattered learning.

His advice was clear:  
>"Don’t complain. Build. Be stubborn. Give a damn."

## Theme 3: **Culture, Courage & Compassion**

### **Sonali Silva**
<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/trpKyifxS1M" 
        title="Sonali Silva TEDxColombo" 
        style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} 
        frameBorder="0" 
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

Sonali spoke about abortion stigma in Sri Lanka.  
She said something that everyone in the room felt:

> “We are privately empathetic, but publicly disapproving.”

Her talk reminded me that silence can be more harmful than disagreement.  
Change starts when we choose to speak with honesty.

### **Kevin Wilson**
<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e85jWs_EzEs" 
        title="Kevin Wilson TEDxColombo" 
        style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} 
        frameBorder="0" 
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

Kevin explained that fear doesn’t have to be an enemy.  
When we welcome it, **life becomes richer and more colorful.**  
He ended by saying something very Sri Lankan:

> “Enna tea ekak bomu” — Let’s sit down for tea and talk.

### **Vikum Nawagamuwa — Closing Reflection**

        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-MVnFkP1Hw" 
        title="Vikum Nawagamuwa TEDxColombo" 
        style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} 
        frameBorder="0" 
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

He explained that > “not giving a f***” doesn’t mean not caring.  
It means caring **about the right things**.  
Let go of noise. Focus on what matters.

### **Anya Ratnayaka — Colombo Wetlands**
<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aiR_3LwjBo" 
        title="Anya Ratnayaka — Colombo Wetlands" 
        style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }} 
        frameBorder="0" 
        allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

Colombo’s wetlands, once overlooked, are now recognized as vital for flood control and for shaping the city’s history. These urban ecosystems support remarkable biodiversity—including the endangered fishing cat—and thrive thanks to interconnected green spaces. Beyond wildlife, wetlands reduce urban heat, improve water quality, and provide restorative spaces that boost mental well‑being. They show that nature and urban life can coexist when planning prioritizes ecological resilience.

Watch Anya Ratnayaka’s talk for a thoughtful perspective on conserving Colombo’s wetlands and engaging communities in their stewardship.


After the event ended, we cleaned up, moved equipment, and guided people out.  
I heard people talking about what they learned.  
It felt good knowing we helped create that space.

## Reflections From the Volunteer Side

- Backstage work matters as much as what’s on stage.  
- MADness means stepping out of comfort, not losing control.  
- The audience completes the story.  
- Volunteers keep the message alive by keeping the event smooth.  
- When the event ends, the real thinking begins.

## Final Thought

TEDxColombo 2025 didn’t give final answers.  
It gave better questions.  
It pushed us to build, fail, learn, adapt, and grow.

Let’s change the narrative—together.
